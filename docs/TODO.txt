[HIGH-PRIO]
1. Implement Opening books
2. Review and fix the repetition moves in winning position (Currently observe 3fold repetition in winning positions)


[MED-PRIO]
1. Amend/Improve PST (The current implementation does not perform better then without ~ 1400 elo)
2. Improve move ordering function (add more best moves at the beginning, e.g. first 10 best moves from previous iteration (for now, only the best one is added))

------------------- BUGS -------------------
[HIGH-PRIO]
1. Review why engine disconnects just after 120th move ??? Occurs in every game ???
2. Review why engine make illegal moves - always "a1a1" which indicate that engine returns 0 as bestmove    Is it valid still ???
    (probably lack of any legal move in position)
